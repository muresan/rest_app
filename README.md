Building a simple web app/api
=============================

In this lesson, weâ€™ll make sure you know how to build a simple webapp.  We're not web developers here, but sometimes the best way to test something is with a representative, quick web app even without a browser frontend.

### Note - Another option is not to build anything at all.
If you'd rather skip it, that's cool too.  Install someone else's simple app and write curl-based API tests for that instead.  We want you to be familiar with REST from a client and server point of view with all four verbs.  We also want you to practice config management of an app for software lifecycle.  Which path focuses on the practice you need/want?

Here are some applications with a REST API suitable for easy testing:
* ???

For reference:

Yours will have to be a little more complex than that.

Copy your variables here from the [Top README](../README.md).

`webapp language` = php

`webapp framework` = php Slim

`webapp type` = REST article management API

For our purposes, MVP is sufficient. Don't get bogged down implementing authentication, sharding or "future-proof" features.  __Build it FAST!__

- [x] 1. Create a webapp framework in this directory `2`
- [ ] 2. Define the functionality of your api by creating curl-based tests `3`
- [ ] 3. Review the tests with your onboarder `3`
- [x] 4. Add routes/views/handlers/whathaveyou to replicate your webapp `3`
- [ ] 5. Hook them up to your data source of choice `3`
- [ ] 6. Iterate until the tests all pass `8`
- [ ] 7. Review the final product with your onboarder `3`

### Thoughts for review
* Is it documented?
* Is it deployable?
* Does it do more than it needs to?
* Does it miss basic functionality?
* Does it include unexpected functionality?  Good?
* Was it fun?
